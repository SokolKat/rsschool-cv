## About me: ##

_I decided to change my life... Work takes about half of the time, so I'm changing my profession! Everything that I lack in my current job is in the profession of a Frontend Developer: demand and high wages, a friendly community, constant development, an abundance of information for self-education, interesting tasks. Wish me luck!_
